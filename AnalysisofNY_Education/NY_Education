--'Percent Tested' category appears to have some NULL entries. Lets see how many, relative to the total amount of schools, in case it's a problem later.

    SELECT 
        COUNT(*) AS num_tested_missing,
        (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM schools) AS num_schools
    FROM schools
    WHERE percent_tested IS NULL

--Hmm, twenty schools don't have any entries of 375 schools. Shouldn't be a problem!

--Lets see what the best schools in NY are, judging by their SAT scores.

    SELECT
    (average_reading + average_writing + average_math) AS avg_sat,
    school_name
    FROM schools
    GROUP BY school_name
    ORDER BY avg_sat DESC
    LIMIT 10;

--This will give us the top 10 schools in NY. #1 is Stuyvesant.

    SELECT school_name,

    FROM schools
    WHERE borough = 'Brooklyn'
    ORDER BY average_math DESC
    LIMIT 5;
--Bop!
